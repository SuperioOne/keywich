## v0.3.0 - April 05, 2024
----------------

## Added

- Profile database backup and restore support.
- Visible log panel button at the footer section. In previous versions, It was only accessible with `Ctrl` + `I` shortcut.
- Version information at the footer section.

## Changed

- `--log_level` flag name changed to `--verbose`. App can now be started as `keywich --verbose debug`.

## Fixes

- Profile databases cannot be initialized with certain master passwords.

## Deleted

- CLI password generator sub-command deleted.

# v0.2.0 - March 14, 2024
----------------

## Added

- Persisted log files and stdout logging.
- GUI can now be started with different log levels (default is `WARN`) via `keywich gui --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>`.

## Fixes

- **BREAKING** Some master passwords generate invalid database encryption keys. All app databases will be
  automatically upgraded to the new passphrase generator. Note that downgrade will not possible after the upgrade.
- A zero-byte `app.db` file no longer breaks profile initialization.

## Known issues

- On Windows, the console is detached from GUI window, making the CLI unusable.
- On Linux, `webkit2gtk >= 2.42.x` when used with Nvidia proprietary drivers, may display an empty window
  with the error message `KMS: DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB failed: Permission denied`. Current known solutions are:
    - Set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` environment variable.
    - Enable `nvidia.drm_modeset=1` kernel parameters.
